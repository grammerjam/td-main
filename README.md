Under te-main/ create an index.html file.

Exercise: 

1. At the bottom of the page, add the following text: "Start Date/Time: XXXXXX" where XXXXXX is your agreed start date/time.
The next line will have the text: "End Date/Time:      " which you will update once finished and approved.

2. On a white background, add 4 squares (350x350 pixels) that are centered and tiled as shown in the image sent to you via chat.
Note: When seen on a mobile-size screen, the squares should be one of top of the other, centered.
